# üöó CARLA_ROS2_MPC (Still under development)

This project integrates the CARLA autonomous driving simulator within the ROS 2 Humble framework to implement and test developed MPC algorithm for vehicle path tracking.

---

## 1. Introduction

This project integrates the CARLA autonomous driving simulator with ROS 2 Humble to implement and test a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm for vehicle path tracking. The core objective is to simulate realistic vehicle control in a dynamic driving environment using MPC with CARLA's physics and visualization engine, allowing for development and future extension toward real-time, sensor-based, or hardware-in-the-loop implementations.

---

## 2. Project Objectives

- Develop an MPC-based steering and throttle control for an autonomous vehicle in a simulated urban scenario.
- Integrate the control system with the CARLA-ROS2 stack.
- Publish a static navigation goal and track the optimal path in real-time.
- Visualize the reference, optimized path, and actual vehicle movement using RViz2.
- Evaluate system behavior and performance through simulation.


## 3. üß† System Architecture Overview

The following diagram describes the communication flow between various ROS 2 nodes and topics used in this MPC-based autonomous driving system:

  Bridges CARLA and ROS2 by publishing:
  - `/carla/agent_0/odometry`, `/vehicle_info`, `/vehicle_status`
  - `/lidar`, `/rgb_view/image`, `/enable_autopilot`, etc.

- **`/mpc_town04_node`**  
  Core node subscribing to:
  - `/carla/agent_0/odometry`, `/waypoints`  
  Publishes:
  - `/vehicle_control_cmd`, `/dubin_path`, `/opt_path`, `/car_marker`

## 8. Data Logging & Plotting

### CSV Logging

- `mpc_town04_node.py` logs data to `~/mpc_logs/` (timestamped files):
  - **vehicle_data_*.csv**: Contains columns for `Time`, `X`, `Y`, `Yaw`, and `Closest_WP_Index`.
  - **control_data_*.csv**: Contains columns for `Time`, `Throttle`, `Steer`, and `Brake`.

---

### Plotting Script

- `plot_mpc_data.py` reads these CSVs to generate:
  - Vehicle trajectory plot.

  - Control inputs over time plot.

## 9. Troubleshooting Tips

Below are common issues encountered during development and their solutions:

### Solver Failure (e.g., `SolverError: Solver 'OSQP' failed`)

**Cause**: Numerical instability or infeasibility in the QP problem.

**Solution**: Ensure `casadi` is installed (`pip install casadi`). Increase solver tolerances or iteration limits in `mpc_path_tracking.py` (e.g., `ipopt.tol=1e-2`, `ipopt.max_iter=1000`). Check if reference path is too far from current position, causing infeasible constraints.

### No Waypoints Received

**Cause**: `static_goal_publisher` didn‚Äôt publish or `carla_waypoint_publisher` failed.

**Solution**: Verify goal publication with `ros2 topic echo /carla/agent_0/goal`. Ensure CARLA server is running on `localhost:2000`.

### Vehicle Won‚Äôt Move

**Cause**: No control commands or solver always fails.

**Solution**: Check `ros2 topic echo /carla/agent_0/vehicle_control_cmd` for throttle/steer values. If zero, debug solver in `mpc_path_tracking.py`.

### RViz2 Shows Nothing

**Cause**: Missing display configurations.

**Solution**: In RViz2, add displays for `/dubin_path` (yellow path), `/opt_path` (green path), and `/car_marker` (vehicle marker). Set fixed frame to `map`.

### CARLA Connection Errors

**Cause**: CARLA server not running or wrong port.

**Solution**: Start CARLA server first (`./CarlaUE4.sh`). Confirm port in launch file matches (2000 by default).

## 10. Summary

Throughout the development process, the following key contributions were made:

- **Pipeline Design**: Created a full CARLA-ROS2-MPC pipeline with modular nodes for goal setting, path planning, and control.
- **Visualization**: Integrated RViz2 markers for reference path (`/dubin_path`), optimized horizon (`/opt_path`), and vehicle pose (`/car_marker`) for real-time monitoring.
